# Trouble-Free-Ploughing-

# PROBLEM DEFINITION
  1. Trouble Free Ploughing overload protection systems protect against damage when the plough point encounters an obstacle.
  2. Crop yield, In ploughing contains lots of obstacles.
  3. Importantly the tractor blades faces the lot of stones and rock.
  4. There is a possibility for the blades to get damaged by the mineral obstacles(rocks) in his cores of action.
  5. This leads to the inefficiency of the procedure. Thereby requiring more effort and time than needed.
  6. In the residence agriculture is the most performed activity and they are facing inconvenience in ploughing.
  7. The hydrologic processes of rainfall and runoff play an essential role in water erosion. 
  8. The amount and rate of surface runoff can affect erosion and sediment transport.

# PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
  1. When using only Tractor , we get less crop yield and takes more time.
  2. Additionally , sensor comes with plougher it takes less time compared to previous step.
  3. Then using advanced plougher , we can get more crop yield .
  4. After filteration ,Unidentified object are filtered .Then we get maximum amount of crop yield and take less time.

# BENEFITS OF THE PRODUCT
  1. We get more benefits from the usage of the machine. 
  2. Such that it reduce the time the blade getting no issues.
  3. It reduce the work pressure.
  4. It is a eco friendly product.
  5. The prime purpose of ploughing is to turn over the uppermost soil, bringing fresh nutrients to the surface while burying weeds and crop remains to decay. 
  6. Trenches cut by the plough are called furrows. 
  7. In modern use, a ploughed field is normally left to dry and then harrowed before planting.
  8. Loosening of soil can improve air circulation.
  9. The roots can penetrate deeper into the soil, thus holding the plant firmly.
  10. Ploughing enhances the water retention capacity of the soil.
  11. Ploughing uproots the weeds growing in the field and aids in the growth of useful microbes.
  12. The blade will prevent from the damage.
  13. Safe and stable and plough control.
  14. Easy maintenance for a long service life and high operational reliability.
